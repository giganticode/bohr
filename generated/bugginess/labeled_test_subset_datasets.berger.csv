MythTV,mythtv,004205015d5f4dcad9d095ed20251b1f96ae53af,"A little more of the new scanner code is in this commit.

Please test DVB scanning in Europe with this commit.

This removes depreciated parts of dvbsignalmonitor, as they
are no longer used in scanwizard. The code now uses the range
and value reporting signals, instead of the old non-range 
reporting signals.

This moves SIScan thread handling code from ScanWizardScanner to SIScan.
Removes the USING_DVB checks on SIScan code in ScanWizard[Scanner] since,
as of  the last scanning checkin, SIScan no longer depends on DVB stuff 
to compile. This also adds some of the pcHDTV v4l scanning code to 
scanwizard, basically everything that doesn't depend on a pcHDTV v4l
enabled SIScan.

Finally, this makes some changes to SIScan, but just header and define
stuff. Everything else depends on using the new FrequencyTable class in
frequencytables.h, but testing by John Pullan seems to indicate that
the new frequency tables are breaking DVB scanning in Europe. So I will
make a patch that just adds the FrequencyTable stuff for testing before
anything goes into svn.

- v6.31.0 April 24, 2013
	- DocPad will now warn you when you have files of the same outPath
	- File and Document IDs will now always be their `cid` (before they
use to be their relativePath on occasion)
	- Fuzzy searching no longer searches for the id
	- Server is now able to serve cached pages while a non-initial
generation is occurring
	- We no longer replace tabs with 4 spaces for the content of files and
documents (we still do it for YAML meta data headers on documents)
		- This means if you're a plugin developer, you may need to update
your plugin's test's `out-expected` folder accordingly
			- If this is too difficult, we've added a `removeWhitespace` config
option for your plugin tester, set it to `true`, [see here for
usage](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-paged/blob/master/src/pag
ed.tester.coffee)
	- Change events will now fire when adding a url to a file
	- URL cache index for serving files is now generated via change
events, rather than after generation",0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The segfault happened because SwitchToProgram() didn't
check for the being errored before resuming playback.

This adds that check in SwitchToProgram().

It also adds it to the StartPlaying() loop. This part is just
so that an error message gets displayed before we exit.

For an extra level of paranoia this also adds a check for a null
context pointer in the packet reading portion of GetFrame(). 
This prevents a segfault if GetFrame() is called when there is 
no context pointer; so long as there it is reset clearing any
buffered packets.

There are still remaining problems in LiveTV that I think are 
sufficiently canvased by the existing tickets; this just prevents
a segfault if we switch to an empty file. Addressing the creation
empty files is a seperate issue.

K2InformaticsGmBH,proper,13dbb5687464c8311de3be3e092d86d8bfb650c3,"Permit caller to ""prime"" PropEr's typeserver and random generator prior to testing

The motivation of this change request is to permit testing of a
module's exported functions by using both PropEr *and* Meck.  Before
Meck is enabled to mock a module, the cache of PropEr's typeserver
must be first populated.  Otherwise, PropEr is unable to gather a
module's specs.

Sample code to illustrate this technique:

````
-spec check_specs(module()) -> term().
check_specs(Mod) ->
    %% pass through to the original Function Under Test (FUT)
    check_specs(Mod, fun(_Module, _Fun, Args) -> meck:passthrough(Args) end, [], []).

-spec check_specs(module(), fun((module(), atom(), list()) -> term())) -> term().
check_specs(Mod, FUT) ->
    check_specs(Mod, FUT, [], []).

-spec check_specs(module(), fun((module(), atom(), list()) -> term()), proplist()) -> term().
check_specs(Mod, FUT, PropErOptions) ->
    check_specs(Mod, FUT, PropErOptions, []).

-spec check_specs(module(), fun((module(), atom(), list()) -> term()), proplist(), proplist()) -> term().
check_specs(Mod, FUT, PropErOptions, MeckOptions) ->
    proper:global_state_erase(),
    proper:global_state_init_size(1),
    case proper_typeserver:get_exp_specced(Mod) of
        {ok, MFAs} ->
            meck:new(Mod, MeckOptions),
            try
                %% @NOTE Expand MFA clauses for larger arity as needed
                Fun = fun({M,F,0}) ->
                              meck:expect(M,F, fun() -> FUT(M, F, []) end);
                         ({M,F,1}) ->
                              meck:expect(M,F, fun(A1) -> FUT(M, F, [A1]) end);
                         ({M,F,2}) ->
                              meck:expect(M,F, fun(A1, A2) -> FUT(M, F, [A1, A2]) end)
                      end,
                lists:foreach(Fun, MFAs),
                proper:check_specs(Mod, PropErOptions)

as suspected `treec` is not quite flexible enough. Instead we now have
a higher order contraint `fixc` which takes a function which must take
3 arguments - the term, the substitution and a reifier. This function
must return a goal. This goal can of course call fixc again
recursively, perhaps using constrain-tree to get tree constraining
behavior. Redefine `treec` in terms of `fixc` as an example :)",0,0,0.61,0.39,0.4
