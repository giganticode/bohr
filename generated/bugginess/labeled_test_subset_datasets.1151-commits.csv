spring-projects,spring-framework,28174744a74e08cc974a54041e304dc4aafa5334,"Fix race when flushing messages--The use of an AtomicBoolean and no lock meant that it was possible-for a message to be queued and then never be flushed and sent to the-broker:--1. On t1, a message is received and isConnected is false. The message-   will be queued.-2. On t2, CONNECTED is received from the broker. isConnected is set-   to true, the queue is drained and the queued messages are forwarded-3. On t1, the message is added to the queue--To fix this, checking that isConnected is false (step 1 above) and the-queueing of a message (step 3 above) need to be performed as a unit-so that the flushing of the queued messages can't be interleaved. This-is achieved by synchronizing on a monitor and performing steps 1-and 3 and synchronizing on the same monitor while performing step 2.--The monitor is held while the messages are actually being forwarded-to the broker. An alternative would be to drain the queue into-a local variable, release the monitor, and then forward the messages.-The main advantage of this alternative is that the monitor is held for-less time. It also reduces the theoretical risk of deadlock by not-holding the monitor while making an alien call. The downside of the-alternative is that it may lead to messages being forwarded out of-order. For this reason the alternative approach was rejected.-",1,c,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,4,2,0,1,0.14,0.86,0.9

HDFS checksum verification-is avoided while reading data into the block cache. On a checksum verification-failure, we retry the file system read request with hdfs checksums switched on-(thanks Todd).--I have a benchmark that shows that it reduces iops on the disk by about 40%. In-this experiment, the entire memory on the regionserver is allocated to the-regionserver's jvm and the OS buffer cache size is negligible. I also measured-negligible (<5%) additional cpu usage while using hbase-level checksums.--The salient points of this patch:--1. Each hfile's trailer used to have a 4 byte version number. I enhanced this so-that these 4 bytes can be interpreted as a (major version number, minor-version). Pre-existing hfiles have a minor version of 0. The new hfile format-has a minor version of 1 (thanks Mikhail). The hfile major version remains-unchanged at 2. The reason I did not introduce a new major version number is-because the code changes needed to store/read checksums do not differ much from-existing V2 writers/readers.--2. Introduced a HFileSystem object which is a encapsulates the FileSystem-objects needed to access data from hfiles and hlogs.  HDFS FileSystem objects-already had the ability to switch off checksum verifications for reads.--3. The majority of the code changes are located in hbase.io.hfie package. The-retry of a read on an initial checksum failure occurs inside the hbase.io.hfile-package itself.  The code changes to hbase.regionserver package are minor.--4. The format of a hfileblock is the header followed by the data followed by the-checksum(s). Each 16 K (configurable) size of data has a 4 byte checksum.  The-hfileblock header has two additional fields: a 4 byte value to store the-bytesPerChecksum and a 4 byte value to store the size of the user data-(excluding the checksum data). This is well explained in the associated-javadocs.--5. I added a test to test backward compatibility. I will be writing more unit-tests that triggers checksum verification failures aggressively. I have left a-few redundant log messages in the code (just for easier debugging) and will-remove them in later stage of this patch. I will also be adding metrics on-number of checksum verification failures/success in a later version of this-diff.--6. By default, hbase-level checksums are switched on and hdfs level checksums-are switched off for hfile-reads. No changes to Hlog code path here.--Test Plan: The default setting is to switch on hbase checksums for hfile-reads,-thus all existing tests actually validate the new code pieces. I will be writing-more unit tests for triggering checksum verification failures.--Reviewers: mbautin--Reviewed By: mbautin--CC: JIRA, tedyu, mbautin, dhruba, todd, stack--Differential Revision: https://reviews.facebook.net/D1521--git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hbase/trunk@1298641 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68-",0,a,0,0,0,0,30,50,3,2,1,1,0,14,29,0,2,16,20,0,9,22,6,5,2,36,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,89,148,0,2,131,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0
